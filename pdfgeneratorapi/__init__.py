From PDFGenerator.com Docs:
With The PDF Generator API your users can easily create and manage different document templates with an easy-to-use
browser based document editor. And, you can use simple HTTP API calls to merge the templates with data from your own
software to generate PDF and HTML documents. Or just use The PDF Generator API as an internal tool to manage and
generate different outputs needed within your software. This way you don’t have to waste your time or your
developers’ time on hard-coding the output layouts.
The PDF Generator API features a web API architecture, allowing you to code in the language of your choice.
This API supports the JSON media type, and uses UTF-8 character encoding.
